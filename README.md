# Grocery Store Operations Optimization via Agent-Based Modeling

This project implements an agent-based model of a grocery store using NetLogo. It aims to simulate, visualize, and optimize various operational processes of a grocery environment including staffing, customer flow, inventory restocking, checkout processes, waste reduction, and queue management.

## Features

âœ… Simulation of multiple store departments  
âœ… Time-based staff shifts and break management  
âœ… Customer shopping, queuing, and checkout behavior  
âœ… Restocking and waste handling  
âœ… Queue management and cashier utilization  
âœ… Inventory expiry and discount mechanisms  
âœ… Visualization of store operations with plots and color-coded patches  
âœ… Store opening and forced closing after specified hours  
âœ… Manager monitoring of busy cashiers  
âœ… Support staff including cleaners, packers, stockers, produce staff, and butchers  
âœ… Agent behaviors for efficient resource allocation  
âœ… Dynamic reporting at store closure

## Agents

- **Customers**  
  - Enter the store at opening time  
  - Browse items and queue for checkout  
  - Seek help from produce or butcher staff  
  - Forced to exit the store at closing time

- **Cashiers**  
  - Process customer payments  
  - Go on break according to shift rules  
  - Record total sales per cashier

- **Stockers**  
  - Restock shelves during store hours and night restocking

- **Packers**  
  - Assist customers in packing purchased goods

- **Cleaners**  
  - Monitor and clean spills

- **Produce & Butcher Staff**  
  - Assist customers  
  - Monitor perishable items and apply discounts before expiry

- **Managers**  
  - Monitor overcrowded queues and deploy interventions

## Store Phases

The simulation divides store operations into logical phases:

1. **Store Preparation** â€” pre-opening stocking and staff arrival  
2. **Customer Journey** â€” browsing, queuing, and payment behavior  
3. **Core Operational Processes** â€” checkout, restocking, packing  
4. **Support Operations** â€” spills, expiry checks, break management  
5. **Closing Operations** â€” final restocking, closing cash registers, cleaning  

## Plots

The model includes several plots to monitor:

- Restocks vs Waste  
- Queue Length Over Time  
- Cashier Utilization  
- Payments Over Time  
- Customers in Store Over Time  
- Staff on Break Over Time

## How to Run

1. Install [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).  
2. Load the `.nlogo` file in the NetLogo GUI.  
3. Click `Setup` to initialize the store.  
4. Click `Go` to start the simulation.  
5. Observe the plots and behaviors of customers and staff agents.  
6. Adjust parameters if desired for experimentation.

## Optimization Goals

This simulation helps explore:

- Optimizing staff schedules  
- Managing queues to reduce customer abandonment  
- Balancing restocking frequency vs waste  
- Designing customer flow layouts  
- Minimizing store closure delays
